# icub-forward-kinematics-inspection
A study on the computation of the forward kinematics of iCub's arm, to inspect potential issues.

### ‚òÅ Launch the cloud workspace
We make use of [Gitpod Cloud IDE](https://gitpod.io) as infrastructure:

### ‚öô Build the project

Move to the project folder, then on a terminal, type
```console
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && make install
```

### üîò Run the project
Running the project requires loading the URDF model of iCub 2.0, 2.5, or 2.7, all provided in the repository.

The project can be executed by launching the `fkin` executable with the following arguments:
- the iCub model: `--model <path_to_urdf_file>`
- the arm type: `--arm [left|right]_vX.Y`
- the joints configuration in degrees: `--joints "(0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0)"`

For more information, type `fkin --help`.

Examples can be found in the `test.sh` script, where various joint configurations for different models of iCub2 are selected.
To use it, run on a terminal `./test.sh <joint_cfg>`, where `joint_cfg` can be either 1, 2, 3, 4.
